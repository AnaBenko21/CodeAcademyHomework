      Green Green is the color between cyan and yellow on the visible spectrum.
      It is evoked by light which has a dominant wavelength of roughly 495â€“570
      nm. In subtractive color systems, used in painting and color printing, it
      is created by a combination of yellow and cyan; in the RGB color model,
      used on television and computer screens, it is one of the additive primary
      colors, along with red and blue, which are mixed in different combinations
      to create all other colors. By far the largest contributor to green in
      nature is chlorophyll, the chemical by which plants photosynthesize and
      convert sunlight into chemical energy. Many creatures have adapted to
      their green environments by taking on a green hue themselves as
      camouflage. Several minerals have a green color, including the emerald,
      which is colored green by its chromium content.
